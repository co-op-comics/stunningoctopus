  tagline: "A webcomic about the tangled webs that housing co-ops weave."
  blurb: "Here we have life celebrations for broken plates and we play guitar beneath stepladders. Here we dance to music and no music. We rip index cards to shreds and break each other's hearts. We are held up by one another's shoulders, and we dislocate still others by throwing housemates off a big comfy cushion. We avoid food poisioning narrowly but can't escape the emotional rollercoasters of incessant house politics. We don't speak up when we should. We slam doors and leave the microwaves beeping late at night. We're awful to each other, and we make sandwiches out of 5 pound blocks of cheese and sourdough pancakes to share. 'You give good hugs', says Pat. 'Where'd you learn?' And you laugh, because the question's funny and because the answer's complicated."
  misc: "This is a webcomic to share snippets of all the stories we've wanted to share from lives as co-opers. Tell us your stories, ask us your questions: <b>cooperativecomic@gmail.com</b>"
  important: "Do we want a bolded line here. ??"
